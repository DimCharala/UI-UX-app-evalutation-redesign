# Microsoft Lens evaluation and redesign

This project was completed by [Stavropoulos Konstantinos](https://github.com/StavropoulosK) and Charalampopoulos Dimitrios for the "Interactive Technologies" course within the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of University of Patras during the Winter Semester of the 2024-2025 academic year.

The goal of this project was to analyze, evaluate, and redesign a mobile scanner app. We chose to focus on [Microsoft Lens](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.officelens&hl=en). We employed various expert-based evaluation methods (Heuristic Evaluation and KLM/GLM) and user-based methods (UEQ Questionnaire and Think-Aloud Protocol) to identify and evaluate the main usability concerns and problems of the application.

Using Figma, we created a [prototype redesign](https://www.figma.com/proto/DEWXOAiI9v0SlVEOiWMIV3/Scanner-App?node-id=0-1&t=IKaZQpYARTGxII1s-1) of Microsoft Lens. This prototype was subsequently evaluated and modified based on user feedback.
